# Creating Beautiful Interactive Reports Automatically with HTML

Presenting analysis results in a clear and inviting way is often as important as the analysis details themselves.  
This repo accompanies a talk given during PyData TLV Lightning Talks #3 meetup, on October 18th 2017.  

Check the notebook index.ipynb to learn how to create beautiful interactive reports that load on any device (including mobile devices) without the need for software installation, by using the Jinja2 templating engine to render HTML files.
The notebook discusses report styling, displaying interactive charts on mouse click or hover, adding sorting, filtering and pagination to our data tables and more.

Feedback and pull requests are welcome.
